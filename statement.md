PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER AND PASSWORD GENERATOR
================================================

Overview
--------
This project is a simple Python program made for the flipped course 
“Introduction to Problem Solving using Python.”  
It lets the user check how strong a password is, and it can also generate 
a strong password automatically.  
The project focuses on basic Python concepts like loops, conditions, functions, 
and simple logic.

Problem Statement
-----------------
Many people use weak or predictable passwords without realising how unsafe they are.  
Since not everyone knows what makes a password “strong,” the idea was to create a small,
easy tool that can:
- check the strength of a given password  
- generate a strong random password  

The goal was to keep the solution simple, clear, and beginner-friendly.

What the Program Does
---------------------
The program has two main features:

1. **Password Strength Checker**  
   It evaluates a password based on:
   - length  
   - uppercase letters  
   - lowercase letters  
   - digits  
   - special characters  
   After checking these conditions, it prints a strength level.

2. **Password Generator**  
   It creates an 8-character password with:
   - 2 uppercase letters  
   - 2 lowercase letters  
   - 2 digits  
   - 2 special characters  
   All characters are shuffled before showing the final output.

Technologies Used
-----------------
- Python 3  
- Built-in `random` module  
- Text-based console interface  

Scope
-----
The project is meant for basic password checking and generation.  
It does not use any files, databases, or external libraries.  
Everything runs locally, and the design focuses on simple Python fundamentals.
