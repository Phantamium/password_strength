PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER AND PASSWORD GENERATOR
================================================

Project Overview
----------------
This project is a simple Python console application that allows the user to check the 
strength of a password or generate a strong password automatically.  
It was created for the flipped course “Introduction to Problem Solving using Python.”

Features
--------
- Menu-based console interface  
- Strength checking based on:
  - length
  - uppercase letters
  - lowercase letters
  - digits
  - special characters
- Strength levels displayed from "Very Weak" to "Very Strong"
- Built-in password generator that creates an 8-character password with a fixed mix of characters
- Characters are shuffled before displaying the final password
- No external dependencies required

Technologies / Tools Used
-------------------------
- Python 3  
- Standard `random` module  
- Console-based program (no additional libraries)

Steps to Install and Run
------------------------
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.  
2. Download or clone the repository.  
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder.  
4. Run the command: python main.py (but make sure that you have used "cd" to get into the directory that that python file is in....)


Instructions for Testing
------------------------
1. Choose option "1" in the menu to test password strength.  
   - Try different passwords with various combinations of characters.
2. Choose option **2** to test the password generator.  
   - Verify that each generated password contains a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
3. Test invalid menu inputs to ensure the program handles them correctly.
